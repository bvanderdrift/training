## Vision
The average commuter working in London spends about two times one hour a day on the train. The perfect length of time to absorb new information is 50 minutes.  Our application makes use of this through bringing teachers and learners together.

Users connect through their social network login. They then state if they would like to learn or teach and what their interests are. After this they enter what time they will travel between which locations. The app then matches the learner with possible teachers and shows what they teach.

The learner can message a teacher to see if they would like to attend a lesson of theirs. If so the learner books the teacher and pays it's lecture fee. The learner and teacher then get seats assigned in the train and they meet up and exchange knowledge!

## Final Product
Due to the project being build in a Hackathon we have hacked together a prototype to show the workings of the application. Because the most important thing was the back-end the front-end has been designed to match the resolution of the demo machine (half the screen of a 1920x1080 monitor). The eventual application would be focussed on the mobile platform, thus the resolution choice.
